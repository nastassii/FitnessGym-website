 h1 align="center">FitnessGym project - the website for a  a network of gyms</h1>


This website is for a a network of gyms. I developed the main page, where the user can read about the company and buy a membership. 
To develop this project, I used only HTML and CSS (Grid CSS). Also I used Sass when writing the styles. 
<br> In the folder ```'css'``` there are all styles of the project.
All of these CSS files make up a build process that was implemented with NPM scripts (you can find them in ```'package.json'``` file). Thus the final file of styles is ```'style.css'```. 
<br>All pictures and icons are stored in the ```'img'``` folder.
<br>```'index.html'``` contains markup symbols or codes inserted into a web page.
<br>```'package-lock.json'``` & ```'package.json'``` contain all packages/dependencies that were installed to create this project.
